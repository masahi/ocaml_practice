(* Partially known dynamic values for array indexing

To make sure that the generated code has no array bound errors, we
need at the code generation time some information about dynamic values
that are to be used as indices of an array.  Specifically, we need the
lower (lwb) and the upper (upb) bounds of the value.  We always assume
that lwb < upb and the value v with the bounds (lwb,upb) satisfies
     lwb <= b < upb

In our application -- stencil computations -- all arrays have the same
length and are 0-indexed (that is, the smallest valid index into the
array is zero). The length of the array is not statically known. We do
assume that it is at least min_high (which we must check, see make_fun
below).

Bounds are treated as abstract outside this module. The constant
min_bounded gives the value corresponding to the smallest index
of the array, and wrappers like make_fun produce the corresponding
bounded value for the upper bound of the array. The loop generators
like forloop annotate the loop variable with the loop bounds.
